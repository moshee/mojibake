Attempt to decrypt mojibake into readable UTF-8. I can't guarantee that all cases have been covered yet. For now it is up to the user to guess what the source encoding might've been. In the future I may add an encoding auto-detect feature.

**Documentation**: [GoPkgDoc](http://go.pkgdoc.org/github.com/moshee/mojibake)

(as if this really needs that much documentation)
